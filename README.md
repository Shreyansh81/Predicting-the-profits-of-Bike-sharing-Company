-by Shreyansh Jain, student from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra

This is my project on machine learning. Languages included : Python

# Goal : 
To predict the profits of Bike sharing Company.

# Problem Statement :
A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model. Create a model which will help him to estimate of what the house would sell for.
